<a name='v9.37'><b>Sept. 14, 2013 - Version 9.37</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Added support for maker notes from Apple iPhone5 iOS 7
<li>Added two more Torrent tags
<li>Added a new Pentax DigitalFilter
<li>Added new Olympus CameraType and LensType values
<li>Decode a couple more Olympus tags
<li>More improvements to Sony decoding (thanks Jos Roost)
<li>Improved decoding of Scalado JPEG APP4 information
<li>Fixed problem where a PreviewImage could be reported in either the File or
    Composite group, depending on the details of the command
</ul>

<a name='v9.36'><b>Sept. 7, 2013 - Version 9.36</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Added read support for BitTorrent description files (bencode format)
<li>Added a couple of new Nikon LensID's (thanks J&uuml;rgen Sahlberg)
<li>Added support for PNG 8bim raw profile
<li>Added or fixed a few Pentax LensType values (thanks Louis Granboulan)
<li>Added ability to delete DNGAdobeData and DNGPrivateData
<li>Decode more Sony tags and improved decoding of others (thanks Jos Roost)
<li>Decode a number of new FujiFilm tags and fixed 2 incorrect Saturation values
<li>Decode a number of Canon CameraInfo tags for the 70D (thanks Tomasz Kawecki)
<li>Patched to issue minor warning and extract only the first 1000 values from
    XMP list-type tags containing more than 1000 items (all values may be
    extracted by ignoring this warning with the -m option)
<li>Patched decoding of PNG IPTC raw profile to allow either IIM or IRB data
<li>Flagged ImageSourceData as "unsafe" (avoids excessive memory usage when
    copying all tags because this data may be larger than the image itself for
    Photoshop TIFF images)
<li>Disabled feature introduced in version 9.14 which allowed multiple tags
    (specified by wildcards) to be copied into a single list.  This feature had
    the unintended side-effect of generating duplicate list items when copying
    list-type tags if there were multiple source tags with the same name.  If
    necessary, -addTagsFromFile may still be used to copy the values of multiple
    tags into a single list.
